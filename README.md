# CPC252-Dermatology-Disease-Prediction

## Overview
This study focuses on exploring the effectiveness of 2 predictive models which are Neural Network (NN) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for diagnosing ESDs. We utilize the Dermatology.csv dataset, which contains 33 features and a single target attribute representing the ESD diagnosis. Both models aim to categorize this target attribute into one of six classes:
- psoriasis
- seboreic dermatitis
- lichen planus
- pityriasis rosea
- chronic dermatitis
- pityriasis rubra pilaris
